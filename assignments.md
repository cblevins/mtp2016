**Participation and Attendance** (25%)

Students are to attend each class having completed the readings, tutorials, or other assignments and be prepared to discuss them. One unexcused absence is allowed per semester, after which any absences will require documentation or impact your final grade. 

**Visual Literacy Discussion Leader** (5%) 

Each student is responsible for a five-minute presentation followed by leading discussion about either a historical or contemporary visualization. The student should critically evaluate the visualization as a form of argument or analysis: Who is the author and what is their message? How do they use visual design to convey this message? Are they successful? Why or why not? Email the instructor a link to the visualization **by 9:00AM on the day you are presenting.**

**Labs** (15%)

We will be learning the three major stages of digital spatial history over the course of three labs: visual design, spatial analysis, and obtaining data. The labs are structured "backwards," beginning with the final product of a digital map and ending with learning how to gather data. The reason for this structure is that data is often the most challenging component of digital projects. Each lab assignment is worth 5% of your final grade and due one week after the lab itself:

- Lab #1: Map Design (**due 2/10**)
- Lab #2: GIS and Spatial Analysis (**due 3/2**)
- Lab #3: Gathering Spatial Data (**due 3/30**)

**Map Analysis** (15%) 

A five-page analysis of 1-2 historical maps or similar primary sources related to the spatial history of the United States. The paper will conduct a close reading of the source as a historical document, analyzing its message and design while contextualizing its significance in the era in which it was made. **Due Wednesday, February 17th**.

**Review Paper** (15%) 

A five- to six-page review essay of a work of spatial history (either a digital project/visualization or a written text). Students will describe the author’s interpretation and evidence, evaluate their effectiveness, and explain the project's broader significance. **Due Friday, March 11th**.

**Final Project** (25%)

In small groups of three to four, students will design their own spatial history projects related to the history of Rutgers University. Students will identify a research question to ask about some spatial dimension of the university’s past, gather and analyze evidence to answer that question, and present their findings in an online exhibit. **Due by the beginning of class on Wednesday, April 27th**
